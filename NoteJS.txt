TYPES OF PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE
1. Level of Abstraction:
Machine Language: This is the lowest-level language, directly understood by the computer's CPU. It consists of binary code (0s and 1s).
Assembly Language: A low-level language that uses mnemonics to represent machine code instructions, making it more readable than machine language. It requires an assembler to translate it into machine code.
High-Level Languages: These languages are designed to be more human-readable and abstract away many of the complexities of hardware. Examples include Python, Java, C++, and JavaScript. They require a compiler or interpreter to translate them into machine code.

2. Programming Paradigms:
Procedural Programming: Focuses on a sequence of instructions or procedures to be executed. Examples include C, Pascal, and Fortran.
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Organizes code around "objects" that encapsulate data and behavior. Examples include Java, C++, Python, and C#.
Functional Programming: Treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing state and mutable data. Examples include Haskell, Lisp, and Scala.
Logic Programming: Expresses computation in terms of logical relations and facts. Prolog is a prominent example.
Scripting Languages: Often interpreted languages used for automating tasks, creating dynamic web content, or extending applications. Examples include Python, JavaScript, Ruby, and PHP.

3. Purpose/Domain:
Web Development: Languages like JavaScript, HTML, CSS (for front-end), Python, PHP, Ruby, Node.js (for back-end).
Mobile Development: Swift (iOS), Java/Kotlin (Android), C# (cross-platform with Xamarin).
Game Development: C++, C#, Java.
Data Science & Machine Learning: Python, R.
Systems Programming: C, C++, Rust.
These categories are not mutually exclusive, and many languages can fall into multiple types depending on their features and how they are used. For instance, Python is a high-level language that supports both procedural and object-oriented programming paradigms, and is widely used in web development and data science.

COMPILED vs INTERPRETED
Compiled Languages:
Process: Source code is translated into machine code (or an intermediate bytecode) by a program called a compiler before execution. This results in an executable file.
Execution: The generated machine code can be directly executed by the computer's CPU.
Characteristics:
Performance: Generally faster as the translation happens once, and the machine code is optimized for the specific architecture.
Error Detection: Compilation errors are detected before runtime, preventing the program from running if errors exist.
Examples: C, C++, C#, COBOL.

Interpreted Languages:
Process: Source code is read and executed line by line by a program called an interpreter during runtime. There is no separate compilation step to create an executable file.
Execution: The interpreter translates and executes each instruction as it encounters it.
Characteristics:
Flexibility: Can be more flexible and allow for dynamic changes during runtime.
Platform Independence: Often more platform-independent as the interpreter handles the translation for the specific operating system.
Performance: Generally slower than compiled languages due to the on-the-fly translation during execution.
Error Detection: Runtime errors are detected when the specific line of code is executed.
Examples: Python, JavaScript, Perl, BASIC.

Hybrid Approaches:
Some languages, like Java and C#, utilize a hybrid approach. Their source code is first compiled into an intermediate bytecode, which is then interpreted by a virtual machine (e.g., JVM for Java). This bytecode can also be further optimized by Just-In-Time (JIT) compilers during runtime, blurring the lines between purely compiled and interpreted.

SCRIPTING LANGUAGE:
Scripting in programming refers to the act of writing scripts, which are typically short programs or sequences of instructions designed to automate specific tasks, manage files, or control the behavior of an existing application or system. It is a subset of programming, distinguished by its focus on task automation and often, but not always, the use of interpreted languages.
Key characteristics of scripting include:
Automation: Scripts are frequently used to automate repetitive tasks, such as file manipulation, system administration, data processing, or web interactions.
Interpreted execution: Many scripting languages are interpreted rather than compiled. This means the code is executed line by line by an interpreter program at runtime, rather than being translated into machine code beforehand. Examples include Python, JavaScript, and Bash.
Integration and "glue code": Scripts often serve as "glue code," connecting different software components or systems to work together, like interfacing a database with a web server.
Simpler syntax and rapid development: Scripting languages often have a simpler syntax compared to traditional programming languages, facilitating faster development and easier learning, especially for specific tasks.
Focus on existing systems: While scripting languages can be used to build applications, their primary role often involves customizing, manipulating, or extending the functionality of existing software or operating systems.
In essence, while all scripting is programming, not all programming is scripting. Scripting emphasizes efficiency in performing specific tasks, often leveraging existing resources and environments.
